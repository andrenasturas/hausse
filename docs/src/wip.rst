This page evokes some topics that are in the backlog of Hausse project.

Structure hardening
*******************

The current primary objective is to determine the best way to handle the context data (the current elements-metadata-settings triplet). When the final decision will be made about this, the first officially stable release of Hausse will be possible.

Easy project bootstraping
*************************

Hausse is designed to be a very simple static website generator. It should be able to help users to kickstart tehirs project as quick as possible, by offering one-click hello-world scripts, and even a interactive interface suggesting the most used and appropriate plugins to use.

New plugins
***********

- Multi-language websites and internationalization enabling plugin
- Images and media handling plugin
